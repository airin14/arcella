Building blocks
===============

Arcella is based on the shoulders of giants and makes use of well established and best-in-class technologies as building
blocks. This is to ensure that Arcella is as good as possible, while being simple to use and easy to extend. Some of
these key technologies include:

* `Symfony Full Stack Framework`_ as foundation for the whole thing
* `Doctrine ORM`_ as abstraction for the database
* `Markdown`_ as markup for Github
* `reStructuredText`_ as markup for the documentation
* `YAML`_ in the configuration files
